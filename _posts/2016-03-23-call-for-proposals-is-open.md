Our Call for Proposals is officially open!

Whether it’s about the numerous challenges you’ve faced or the new outcomes you’ve discovered from running experiments - we want you to share your experience at the Agile Singapore Conference.

Submissions will open for two months and close at the end of 24th May 2016.
