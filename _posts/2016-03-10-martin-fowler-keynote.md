We're excited to have Martin Fowler in the conference, and he will present at the closing keynote!

Martin Fowler is a very well sought-after speaker, author and an influential figure in software development. He has authored many popular books like [Refactoring - Improving the Design of Existing Code](http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html), [Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture](http://martinfowler.com/books/eaa.html) and [many more](http://martinfowler.com/aboutMe.html). We believe his participation will amplify the inspiration to many who attend the conference.

If you are flying out, plan your trip well so that you don't miss him.
