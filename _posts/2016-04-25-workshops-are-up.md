We're finally announcing the three one-day workshops to be delivered by the invited speakers at the conference.

4th Oct - The Art of Refactoring by Joshua Kerievsky

5th Oct - How to get more value out of User Stories by Gojko Adzic

8th Oct - Game Thinking by Amy Jo Kim

These popular workshops are delivered by the authors/originators themselves. Seats are limited so register early before it sold out.

We have almost all the confirmed topics from invited speakers. At the time of writing, there are 22 topics published and we are expecting a few more. We hope it provides you with a better view of the conference before the final programme is published in June after the closing of [call for proposals](http://2016.agilesingapore.org/call-for-proposals-themes.html).
