    <p>Coaching people to enjoy working in collaborative, learning environments excites Aaron.  Especially in pursuit of building lovable products. People ask him to train, consult, mentor and facilitate teams to better use a set of Agile discovery and development concepts, tools, methods and practices. The whole set gets absorbed through interactive <a href="http://www.scrumalliance.org/community/profile/asanders" target="_blank">training</a>, applied in context. And it usually takes more practice for it all to sink in. Coaching allows Aaron to sense an impactful situation, helping people to integrate the set of Agile concepts, tools, methods and practices that much faster. Aaron’s effectiveness results from experiences spanning over two decades in technological and interpersonal disciplines. For him, there’s always room for improvement. Pairing with others helps improve Aaron’s collaboration skills while increasing the customer’s benefit, so he consistently seeks out people to co-train and coach with.

  - title: "Learning faster: Scrum's compatibility with Lean UX, Lean Startup, Design Thinking and other discovery elements"
    abstract: >
      <p>What do these items have in common? Most speak of cross-functional collaboration, and a few outright refer to XP as the best set of current working technical practices. This talk assumes you've got the XP/Scrum iterative development engine running, maybe even with DevOps and continuous development going.
      </p>
      <p>What’s next? Wouldn’t it be worthwhile to talk to people that will use the solution? Even on some internal thing like a Salesforce integration? What outcomes really matter to your users? Given that unused features (which there seems to be lots of) provide no value, what’s the least amount that can be done to assure what gets released, gets used?
      </p>
      <p>The Scrum/XP development engine is the delivery track. How you’re learning to quickly deliver the right outcomes, the fuel for that engine, is the discovery track. Coined by some as Dual-Track Scrum, these tracks are meant to run in parallel for each and every Scrum team, all the time.
      </p>

      Why would you want to do that? As one CTO in the health care industry put it to me, he had a few people on a product innovation council, and has a few hundred in product development. Building more, at a faster rate, with Scrum to him seemed a waste of time if nobody used it. Ideas were also stalling in the council’s New Product Introduction process. He saw dual-track as a better way to serve the customers and their needs.

    - title: "The Future of Test Automation"
      abstract: >
        <p>Processing is getting cheaper, software is getting more distributed and clouds are taking over. These trends will have a significant impact on what we can do with test automation and what will make sense to automate in the future. Prohibitively expensive testing strategies are becoming relatively cheap, and things that we didn’t even consider automating will become quite easy. At the same time, strategies that served us well for on-premise reliable hardware simply won't work for the distributed, fragmented, virtualised platforms.
        </p>
        <p>Gojko presents emerging trends in the testing tools space and predicts how you'll be using tools differently ten years from now. If your organisation is suffering from the high cost of testing, come and learn about tools and trends that may help you outrun the competition.

      abstract: "Continuous delivery is not just a technical tool. Regardless of whether we want it or not, it creates a fundamental change to the world around software teams, including marketing and customer interaction. Ignoring those changes is dangerous, because it can lead to conflicts with the rest of the company. Embracing those changes and exploiting them opens up new business opportunities. By recognising and taking charge in this transformation, software teams can become much more valuable to the companies around them. This talk will focus on how to unlock all that potential, and turn the fact that your teams can deliver frequently into an engine that will help you outrun your competition. This is a talk for tech and business people."

  topics:
    - title: "The Secrets of Facilitating Retrospectives and other Meetings"
      abstract: >
        <p>Retrospectives and other meetings are typically the events where information is shared and decisions are made. This means, that a lot of work is done or at least guided by such meetings. Moreover as a coach, most often you are leveraging retrospectives and other meetings in order to introduce change or to deal with challenges during change.
        </p>
        <p>Luckily, meanwhile there are a lot of books available focusing on techniques, activities, games, and the structure of retrospectives. These books and the respective courses provide a good foundation for leading a retrospective. Yet, these are tools only. Because, although we often have a great toolbox of facilitation techniques handy, the retrospectives we're facilitating aren't always successful. The reason is that we're putting too much emphasis on games, activities, and formats and too less on the craft of facilitation. In this session you will learn what to focus on when preparing a retrospective (or a similar facilitated event), how to ensure that as a facilitator you will have the "right" attitude, and how to ensure smooth group decisions. By understanding the role of the facilitator you will learn for example, how to keep all participants engaged (even the quiet ones and without having the talkatives using up the whole time), or how to deal with issues that are not solvable by the team.
        </p>
        <p>In this session I want to share my experiences based not only on having facilitated many retrospectives, yet also on having completed both a course of teacher training and of professional facilitation.

    - title: "Sociocracy – A means for true agile organizations"
      abstract: >
        <p>Sociocracy is a way for groups and organizations to self-organize. Based on four principles only (self-organizing teams, shared decision making based on consent, double-linking, and electing people to functions and tasks), sociocracy provides a path for existing organizations toward empowerment and self-responsibility on all levels. It enables managers to become agile leaders. Different to comparable models, sociocracy allows companies to start where they are – with their existing organizational structures and the like. It seems to be a perfect fit for organizations which are in the need to be agile truly (due to market pressure), beyond their IT departments and software teams.
        </p>
        <p>Moreover, on the team level - sociocracy provides a means for the Scrum Master and/or coach to enable self-organization.

Agile methods, in particular Extreme Programming, give us a highly iterative and evolutionary approach which is particularly well suited to changing requirements and environments.

        </p>
        <p>Friction. No matter how well things are going, there will always be friction. Consumers experience friction when using your product. Friction delays a team's response to a product request. Friction makes the code difficult to change. Differing expectations create friction among team members. Competing goals create friction between teams.
        </p>
        <p>This talk looks at the most common sources of friction in software systems, and present patterns for reducing friction that can be used again -- and again -- to identify and address points of friction on an on-going basis.

      abstract: >
        <p>On Agile teams, collaboration is the way of life. Our leaders want their team members to work closely with each other, have shared goals and even think as one entity. Why? Because we believe that collaboration leads to happier, more productive teams that can build innovative products/services.
        </p>
        <p>It's strange that companies use the word collaboration very tightly with innovation. Collaboration is based on consensus building, which rarely leads to visionary or revolutionary products/services. Innovative/disruptive concepts require people to independently test out divergent ideas without getting caught up in collaborative boardroom meetings.
        </p>
        <p>In this presentation, Naresh Jain explores the scary, unspoken side of collaboration and explains in what context, collaboration can be extremely important; and when it can get in the way or be a total waste of time.
