  bio: >
    <p>I am an author, speaker… essentially a loud-mouthed pundit on the topic of software development. I work for ThoughtWorks, a software delivery company, where I have the exceedingly inappropriate title of “Chief Scientist”. I’ve written half-a-dozen books on software development, including Refactoring and Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture. I write regularly about software development on martinfowler.com

  topics:
    - title: "Software Design in the 21st Century"
      abstract: "In the last decade or so we've seen a number of new ideas added to the mix to help us effectively design our software. Patterns help us capture the solutions and rationale for using them. Refactoring allows us to alter the design of a system after the code is written. Agile methods, in particular Extreme Programming, give us a highly iterative and evolutionary approach which is particularly well suited to changing requirements and environments. Martin Fowler has been a leading voice in these techniques and will give a suite of short talks featuring various aspects about his recent thinking about how these and other developments affect our software development."

  bio: >
    <p>Mary Poppendieck started her career as a process control programmer, moved on to manage the IT department of a manufacturing plant, and then ended up in product development, where she was both a product champion and department manager.
    </p>
    <p>Mary considered retirement 1998, but instead found herself managing a government software project where she first encountered the word "waterfall." When Mary compared her experience in successful software and product development to the prevailing opinions about how to manage software projects, she decided the time had come for a new paradigm. She wrote the award-winning book Lean Software Development: An Agile Toolkit in 2003 to explain how the lean principles from manufacturing offer a better approach to software development.
    </p>
    <p>Over the past several years, Mary has found retirement elusive as she lectures and teaches classes with her husband Tom. Based on their on-going learning, they wrote a second book, Implementing Lean Software Development: From Concept to Cash in 2006, a third, Leading Lean Software Development: Results are Not the Point in 2009, and a fourth book, The Lean Mindset: Ask the Right Questions in 2013. A popular writer and speaker, Mary continues to bring fresh perspectives to the world of software development.

  topics:
    - title: "The Future has Arrived"
      abstract: "2020 used to be far in the future. Today it’s four years away. We no longer need to guess what breakthroughs await us in that magic year, the future is hiding in plain sight. The Cloud, Big Data, the Internet of Things, Virtual Reality. The question is not what the technologies of 2020 will be – that is rapidly coming into focus. The real question is: What’s important, what isn’t, and why? Should you focus on Continuous Delivery? DevOps? How do you get from where you are now to where you need to be? How do you scale? How do you keep your systems reliable and secure? This talk will discuss how software engineering is changed by the emerging digital technologies."
