      <h2><i class="fa fa-ticket"></i> Ticket Pricing</h2>
      <p>This conference is non-profit and we set the prices to cover the expenses with some margin of risk. From the
        amazing line up of speakers we got, this is probably the best value for money conference you can find.</p>
      <p>There will also be pre and post conference workshops around the conference. We will announce that together with the
        release of registration in March.</p>
      <p>We hope the following information can help you in preparing to attend.</p>

            <td>Pair Social Share (meetup + facebook + linkedin + twitter) at 30% off<br/>
              <small>Includes Conference Access benefits. A special ticket that will only be valid for <strong>two</strong>
                 registrations with sharing in the social medium. The purpose of a pair is to encourage others to join. We believe this will help smaller companies and those who self-sponsored.
