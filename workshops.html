            <h2>The Art of Refactoring</h2>

            </ul>
            <p>Code that is difficult to understand, hard to modify and challenging to extend is hazardous to developers, users and organizations. Refactoring, or improving the design of existing code, is one of our greatest defenses against such code. Yet many programmers lack formal training in refactoring. Furthermore, management tends to lack knowledge about the value of refactoring.  This one-day workshop is designed to address these needs.

            <p>Have you struggled to split user stories into small but valuable chunks? Do you have problems prioritising stories or getting a commitment from business stakeholders on what they want to achieve?

If so, join this interactive workshop and bring your product owners and business sponsors to learn how to get the most out of user stories.
