      <div class="collapse" id="what">

        <p>Today, with the advancement of technology and rapid changes in the business environment, many companies are turning to Agile practices for ideas to innovate, reduce the cost of change and increase customers and development teams engagement. It is more commonly known nowadays that companies deliver incremental and iterative changes on an ongoing basis, in contrast to months or years in between releases.
  This is one of the abilities you can gain a competitive advantage by competing on change.
        </p>
        <p>Agile is a manifesto containing four values and twelve principles describing software development approaches that are based on trust and respect each other, promote quicker feedback and technical excellence.</p>
        <p>17 software development visionaries authored the Agile Manifesto in 2001 at Snowbird, Utah. Representatives from lightweight practices like eXtreme Programming, Scrum, DSDM, etc. convened this meeting to find common grounds among their methods. Being thought leaders of that time, and some of them continued to be highly influential. These leaders include Kent Beck, Martin Fowler, Dave Thomas, Robert C. Martin and Ken Schwaber.
