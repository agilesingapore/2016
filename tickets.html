      <p>This conference is non-profit and we set the prices to cover the expenses with some margin of risk. From the
        amazing line up of speakers we got, this is probably the best value for money conference you can find.</p>
      <p>There will also be pre and post conference workshops around the conference. We will announce the details later this month.</p>
